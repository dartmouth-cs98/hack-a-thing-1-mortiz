## Project Overview
This app uses Optimal Character Recognition(OCR) to recognize text on paper and displays it. The displayed text can be saved by tapping the 'Capture' button. On clicking the button, the Main Activity switches to a second activity. On the second activty, the user can have the text narrated to him by tapping on the Speak button. 

## Project Takeaways
This project taught me how to design and implement an android application using Android Studio. I learned how to properly format user interfaces, navigate between Activities, and work with phone's camera. Considering this is one of my first smartphone applications, I now have a better understanding of building and running an application both on an emulator and a Samsung Galaxy S7. Overall, the project served as useful experience with Android Studio and sets a basic foundation for designing future android applications.

## Technical Obstacles/Considerations
OCR detects few words successfully, but become inefficient when presented with jumbles of text, or too many words (as in a paragraph).
